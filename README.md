# This project was an investment calculator that shows the benefits of adding monthly deposits.
# It would prompt the user for the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest, and the time frame in years.
# Then it would display the calculations of the given inputs both with and without the monthly deposit.

# I am proud of this code. It took quite a bit of time trying to wrap my head around how to do the compound interest with loops.
# Still, I think I picked the best way to caluclate and display within the same loop.

# I didn't know how to break the the code into separate .h and .cpp files.
# If I did so, it would have been cleaner and more secure. I could have incorporated private classes/members

# As mentioned earlier, the most challenging part to write was the compound interest calculation using loops.
# I think I made it more difficult because I wanted to display the data within the same loop.
# The other issue I had with it was when I defined the variables for the interest calculation, they were initialized to the end of the first month.
# Thus I had to incorporated it into the calculation loop and ensure that the right month was being displayed to the screen.
# It sounds easy, but it was way over my head at the time.
# I used other online investment calculators and ensured the correct data was being calculated/displayed.

# In this project, I gained a better understanding of classes, passing arguement, and returning values.
# Now when I code, I can confidently work with classes and clear my main.

# Classes! I used a lot of classes. It help to limit repeating code. It made it easier to read/understand. If there were problems in the code,
# I would be able to isolate them to classes. 
# Again, I do wish I used .h and .cpp files, but the classes helped to keep the main clean and everything categorized.
